## Description
Slay the Spire is a single-player, turn-based strategy game. The purpose of this game is to complete all the challenges on the map. At first, the player chooses a character to play in the game. The player starts the game from the beginning of the map with the chosen character. The map consists of different locations, which are rooms of hostile enemies, resting areas, treasure rooms, unknown rooms or merchants. The player has a deck of cards that can be extended via the merchants, treasures or fights. The deck is used during the turn-based fights. In each turn, several cards are randomly distributed to the player’s hand from the deck. Then the player can use these cards for attack or defense purposes. At the resting areas, the player can rest or smith. If the player decides to rest, he gains some percentage of his health point, otherwise, the player can upgrade a card from his deck. In the treasure rooms, there are chests that contain various awards. The player can buy cards, potions or relics from merchants by paying the gold that he gained throughout the game. Potions and relics are the kind of buffs for the fights. In unknown rooms, the player may encounter enemies, treasures, shops or different events. The game is over when the player slays the boss at the final room of the map or when the player dies.
